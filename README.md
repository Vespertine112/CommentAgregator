# CommentAggregator
This tool utilizes the Youtube API to pull the youtube comments from a given video. It can output these into a standard '.txt' file, or output to the console.
# Usage
The .gitignore contains config.json. You need to enter your individual API key for youtube to begin utilizing the tool.
The aggregator saves the .txt file with the number of likes the comment received appended to the beginning of the comment. 
# Future
I will be updating this repository as time goes on, with future functionality and GUI.
